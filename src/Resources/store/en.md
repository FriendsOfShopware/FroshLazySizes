Is google complaining about the image sizes of your shop?

Shopware calculates the "Sizes" based on a simple way that doesn't fit in most cases.



With the help of this plugin, the "sizes" for the images are calculated based on the possible space and you gain performance and loading time.

This plugin is part of [@FriendsOfShopware](https://store.shopware.com/en/friends-of-shopware.html).  
Maintainer from the plugin is: [Sebastian KÃ¶nig (tinect)](https://github.com/tinect)
